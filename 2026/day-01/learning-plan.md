# 90 Days DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## Current Level
I am a BTech CSE student (2nd year) specializing in Cloud Computing with basic knowledge of Linux, AWS, Docker, and Python.

## Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture that bridges development and operations to deliver software faster, reliably, and at scale using automation, CI/CD, cloud, and monitoring.

Cloud provides scalable infrastructure and managed services that enable DevOps practices efficiently.

## Why I am learning DevOps & Cloud
I want to build real-world production skills, work on scalable systems, and prepare myself for DevOps/Cloud Engineer roles.

## Where I want to reach (90-Day Goals)
1. Deploy a production-ready application using Docker, CI/CD, and AWS.
2. Gain strong hands-on experience with Linux, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes basics.
3. Build a public GitHub portfolio with documented DevOps projects.

## Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build
- Linux troubleshooting & shell scripting
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Docker & Kubernetes fundamentals

## Weekly Time Commitment
- Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours/day  
- Weekends: 4–6 hours/day

## Consistency Plan
I will study daily, track progress on GitHub and LinkedIn, and focus on discipline over perfection.
