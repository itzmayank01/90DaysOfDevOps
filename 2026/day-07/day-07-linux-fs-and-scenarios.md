\# Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy \& Scenario-Based Practice



\## Part 1: Linux File System Hierarchy



\### /

\- Root directory and starting point of the Linux file system.

\- All other directories exist under this.



I would use this when understanding the overall structure of a Linux server.



---



\### /home

\- Contains home directories of normal users.

\- Example: /home/mayank



I would use this when working with user files, scripts, and Git repositories.



---



\### /root

\- Home directory of the root (administrator) user.

\- Different from / (root directory).



I would use this when performing critical administrative tasks.



---



\### /etc

\- Stores configuration files for the system and services.

\- Services like SSH, Docker, Nginx read configs from here.



I would use this when troubleshooting service configuration issues.



---



\### /var/log

\- Contains log files generated by services and the system.

\- First place to check when something fails.



I would use this when debugging crashes or production incidents.



---



\### /tmp

\- Temporary files stored here.

\- Files may be deleted after reboot.



I would use this for short-lived testing files.



---



\### /bin

\- Essential system binaries like ls, cp, mv.



---



\### /usr/bin

\- User-level binaries like git, python, docker.



---



\### /opt

\- Optional or third-party applications.



---



\## Part 2: Scenario-Based Practice



\### Scenario 1: Service Not Starting



Step 1: systemctl status myapp  

Why: To check if the service is running, stopped, or failed.



Step 2: journalctl -u myapp -n 50  

Why: To view recent logs and identify errors.



Step 3: systemctl is-enabled myapp  

Why: To check if the service starts automatically on boot.



Step 4: systemctl restart myapp  

Why: To attempt restarting after diagnosing the issue.



---



\### Scenario 2: High CPU Usage



Step 1: top  

Why: Shows live CPU usage and running processes.



Step 2: ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10  

Why: Identifies processes consuming the most CPU.



---



\### Scenario 3: Finding Service Logs



systemctl status docker  

journalctl -u docker -n 50  

journalctl -u docker -f  



Why: To check Docker service status and logs.



---



\### Scenario 4: File Permission Issue



Step 1: ls -l /home/user/backup.sh  

Why: To check current file permissions.



Step 2: chmod +x /home/user/backup.sh  

Why: Adds execute permission.



Step 3: ./backup.sh  

Why: Runs the script after fixing permissions.
