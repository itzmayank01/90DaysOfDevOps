# Day 10 Challenge – File Permissions & File Operations

## Files Created
- devops.txt
- notes.txt
- script.sh
- project/

## Permission Changes
- script.sh: made executable using chmod +x
- devops.txt: set to read-only
- notes.txt: permission set to 640
- project/: permission set to 755

## Commands Used
touch, echo, vim, cat, head, tail, chmod, mkdir, ls -l

## What I Learned
1. Linux permissions control access using read, write, execute.
2. Execute permission is mandatory to run scripts.
3. Permission errors help protect system files.
